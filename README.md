### Nice To Meet You!
My name is Benjamin, and I am a Data Analytics and Applied Mathematics student at Denison University. Currently, I am a Research Intern at Wayne State University, working on their PHOENIX team. My primary focus is on utilizing predictive statistical methods to analyze low-level environmental data and scientific text. My acedemic interests include statistics, pollution, and the philosophy. 

In my spare time, I enjoy backpacking, climbing, photography/travel journaling (<a href="https://www.benwedepohl.com/portfolio" target="_blank">check out my portfolio!</a>), and tinkering with various projects.

Thanks for reading 👋
