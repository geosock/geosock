### Nice To Meet You!
My name is Benjamin, and I am a Data Analytics and Applied Mathematics student at Denison University. Currently, I am a Research Intern at Wayne State University, working on their PHOENIX team. My primary focus is on utilizing predictive statistical methods to analyze low-level environmental data and scientific text. My acedemic interests include statistics, applied sciences such as biology and ecology, and the occasional art course. 

### What I'm Working On:
- Machine learning model designed to identify numerical definitions within text files]

- Web application to gather points of interest from Google Places and Maps APIs without wasting query space. 

In my spare time, I enjoy backpacking, photography/travel journaling (<a href="https://www.benwedepohl.com/portfolio" target="_blank">check out my portfolio!</a>), drawing, and tinkering with various projects.

Thanks for reading ðŸ‘‹
